git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-development-workflow.git
cd ai-development-workflow
chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh

# Initialize and configure with FREE AI
pc init my-free-project
cd my-free-project
aiw setup  # Choose "Local Model (Ollama) - FREE"
aiw chat   # Start coding with free AI!
```

### Option 2: Follow the Sample Project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-development-workflow.git
cd ai-development-workflow/sample-project
./scripts/setup-local.sh
# Follow WORKFLOW_EXECUTION_LOG.md step-by-step
```

### Option 3: Use Templates Only
```bash
cd ai-development-workflow
# Choose from various project templates
cp -r templates/project-templates/saas-dashboard my-project
cd my-project
# Follow template-specific setup instructions
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Available Tools

### 1. Persona Manager (`pc`)
Manage AI personas and project initialization:
```bash
pc init my-project          # Initialize new project
pc list-personas            # List available personas
pc get-persona "Frontend Developer"  # Get persona context
pc start-phase discovery    # Start workflow phase
pc status                   # Show project status
```

### 2. AI Integration (`aiw`)
Direct AI integration for development:
```bash
aiw setup                    # Configure AI provider (OpenAI, Claude, Ollama)
aiw chat                     # Interactive AI chat with persona context
aiw generate                 # Generate code with AI assistance
aiw history                  # View conversation history
aiw export                   # Export AI session data
```

### 3. Workflow Tracker (`wt`)
Track progress and maintain quality:
```bash
wt init                # Initialize workflow tracking
wt status              # Show detailed progress dashboard
wt update-task         # Update task status and hours
wt complete-phase      # Complete phase with quality gates
wt add-task            # Add custom tasks to phases
wt report              # Generate progress report
```

## üé≠ How It Works

### 1. Project Initialization
```bash
# Create new project with AI workflow
pc init my-ecommerce-app

# Choose project type: Basic Web App, Mobile App, SaaS Dashboard
# Select team roles: Frontend Dev, Backend Dev, UX Designer, etc.
# Pick workflow: Agile Development, Design Sprint, Continuous Deployment
```

### 2. AI-Powered Development
```bash
# Setup your preferred AI provider
aiw setup

# Start AI chat with automatic persona context
aiw chat

# In chat:
# - Type "persona Frontend Developer" to switch context
# - Ask: "Create a product card component with image, title, price"
# - AI responds with persona-specific, contextual code
# - Generated code can be saved directly to files
```

### 3. Progress Tracking
```bash
# Track your progress through phases
wt status

# Update task completion
wt update-task

# Complete phases with quality gate validation
wt complete-phase
```

### 4. Automated Quality Gates
Each phase includes built-in quality gates:
- **Discovery**: Requirements completeness, technical feasibility
- **Design**: Design consistency, user validation
- **Development**: Code quality, test coverage
- **Implementation**: Performance benchmarks, security validation
- **Deployment**: Production readiness, monitoring setup

## üîÑ Real Development Example

Here's how a developer would build a feature using this workflow:

```bash
# 1. Initialize project
pc init todo-app
cd todo-app

# 2. Setup AI integration
aiw setup  # Choose OpenAI/Claude/Ollama

# 3. Start discovery phase
pc start-phase discovery
aiw chat

# In AI chat (with Product Manager persona):
# "Define requirements for a todo app with user authentication"

# 4. Move to design phase
wt complete-phase
pc start-phase design

# Switch to UX Designer persona and ask:
# "Design a todo list interface with add, edit, delete, and filter functionality"

# 5. Implementation phase
pc start-phase implementation

# Generate components:
aiw generate
# Choose "React Component"
# Describe: "TodoItem component with checkbox, text, edit, and delete buttons"
# AI generates complete component with TypeScript, tests, and styling

# 6. Track progress
wt update-task  # Mark tasks as completed
wt status       # See overall progress
```
