# Workflow Templates

Complete development methodologies that integrate AI throughout the process.

## Available Workflows

### [Agile Development](agile/)
Sprint-based iterative development methodology
- **Duration**: 1-2 week sprints
- **Team Size**: 3-10 people
- **Best For**: Feature development, iterative improvements
- **AI Integration**: Planning, development, review phases

### [Design Sprint](design-sprint/)
5-day rapid prototyping methodology
- **Duration**: 5 days
- **Team Size**: 5-8 people
- **Best For**: New features, problem solving, validation
- **AI Integration**: Research, design, testing phases

### [Continuous Deployment](continuous-deployment/)
Automated deployment and delivery methodology
- **Duration**: Continuous
- **Team Size**: 2-20 people
- **Best For**: Production applications, frequent releases
- **AI Integration**: Development, testing, deployment phases

## Workflow Comparison

| Workflow | Duration | Team Size | Best For | AI Integration |
|----------|----------|-----------|----------|----------------|
| **Agile Development** | 1-2 weeks | 3-10 people | Feature development | Planning, coding, review |
| **Design Sprint** | 5 days | 5-8 people | Problem solving | Research, design, testing |
| **Continuous Deployment** | Continuous | 2-20 people | Production apps | Development, testing, deploy |

## Quick Start Guide

### Choose Your Workflow

#### For Feature Development
**Agile Development** - Iterative approach with regular feedback
- Sprint planning with AI assistance
- Daily development with AI coding help
- Sprint review with AI analysis

#### For New Features/Problems
**Design Sprint** - Rapid validation and prototyping
- Day 1: Understand the problem
- Day 2: Sketch solutions
- Day 3: Decide on approach
- Day 4: Prototype
- Day 5: Test with users

#### For Production Applications
**Continuous Deployment** - Automated delivery pipeline
- Automated testing and deployment
- Continuous monitoring and feedback
- Rapid iteration and improvement

## AI Integration Points

### Planning Phase
- **ProjectManager** persona for requirements gathering
- **ProductManager** persona for feature prioritization
- AI prompts for timeline estimation and risk assessment

### Development Phase
- **FrontendDeveloper** persona for UI implementation
- **BackendDeveloper** persona for API development
- AI prompts for code generation and review

### Review Phase
- **QAEngineer** persona for testing and validation
- **DevOpsEngineer** persona for deployment
- AI prompts for performance analysis and optimization

## Example Workflow Usage

### Agile Development Example
```
Week 1: Sprint Planning
- Use ProjectManager persona to define sprint goals
- Use ProductManager persona to prioritize features
- Use AI prompts to estimate story points

Week 2: Development
- Use FrontendDeveloper persona for component creation
- Use BackendDeveloper persona for API development
- Use AI prompts for code generation and testing

Week 3: Review
- Use QAEngineer persona for testing
- Use AI prompts for performance analysis
- Sprint retrospective with improvement suggestions
```

### Design Sprint Example
```
Day 1: Understand
- Use UXDesigner persona for user research
- Use AI prompts for competitor analysis
- Define problem statement and success metrics

Day 2-3: Sketch & Decide
- Use UXDesigner persona for solution design
- Use AI prompts for design inspiration
- Create storyboard and prototype plan

Day 4-5: Prototype & Test
- Use FrontendDeveloper persona for prototype creation
- Use AI prompts for user testing scenarios
- Validate solution with real users
```

## Integration with Other Templates

### Personas
Each workflow uses specific personas:
- **Agile**: ProjectManager, Developer personas, QAEngineer
- **Design Sprint**: UXDesigner, ProductManager, FrontendDeveloper
- **Continuous Deployment**: DevOpsEngineer, Developer personas

### Prompts
Workflows integrate with prompt templates:
- **Development Prompts**: For coding and implementation
- **Design Prompts**: For UI/UX design
- **Deployment Prompts**: For infrastructure and deployment

### Projects
Workflows work with all project templates:
- **Basic Web App**: Agile or Continuous Deployment
- **Mobile App**: Design Sprint for new features
- **SaaS Dashboard**: Continuous Deployment for production

## Best Practices

### Workflow Selection
1. **Consider Team Size**: Larger teams work better with Agile
2. **Project Type**: New features benefit from Design Sprint
3. **Release Frequency**: Frequent releases need Continuous Deployment
4. **Risk Tolerance**: Higher risk projects benefit from Design Sprint

### AI Integration
1. **Start with Personas**: Use appropriate personas for each phase
2. **Use Specific Prompts**: Reference prompt templates for guidance
3. **Iterate and Improve**: Refine AI usage based on results
4. **Measure Success**: Track improvements in development speed and quality
