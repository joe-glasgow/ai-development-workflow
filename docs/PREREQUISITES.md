# Prerequisites for AI-Powered Development Workflow

Welcome to the AI-Powered Development Workflow! This guide will help you get set up with everything you need to start "vibe coding" with AI assistance. Don't worry if you're new to development - we'll walk you through each step.

## ðŸŽ¯ What is "Vibe Coding"?

"Vibe Coding" is the modern approach to development where you collaborate with AI to build software faster and more efficiently. Instead of struggling with syntax or getting stuck on implementation details, you focus on the creative and strategic aspects while AI handles the heavy lifting.

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites Checklist

### Essential Skills (Don't worry - we'll help you learn!)

- [ ] **Basic Computer Skills**: Comfortable using a computer, installing software, and navigating file systems

- [ ] **Command Line Basics**: Ability to open a terminal/command prompt and run simple commands
- [ ] **Web Browser Skills**: Comfortable browsing the internet and following links

### Required Software

#### 1. **Git (Version Control)**
Git helps you track changes to your code and collaborate with others.

**Why you need it:** Essential for managing code changes and working with our workflow tools.

**Installation:**
- **Windows**: Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- **Mac**: Install via Homebrew: `brew install git` or download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
- **Linux**: `sudo apt install git` (Ubuntu/Debian) or `sudo yum install git` (CentOS/RHEL)

**Quick Test:**
```bash
git --version
# Should show something like: git version 2.39.0
```

#### 2. **Node.js (JavaScript Runtime)**
Node.js allows you to run JavaScript outside of web browsers and is needed for our CLI tools.

**Why you need it:** Our workflow tools are built with Node.js and require it to run.

**Installation:**
- Visit [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) and download the LTS version
- Follow the installer instructions for your operating system

**Quick Test:**
```bash
node --version
npm --version
# Should show version numbers for both
```

#### 3. **Code Editor**
A good code editor makes development much easier.

**Recommended Options:**
- **VS Code** (Free, most popular): [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- **Cursor** (AI-powered): [cursor.sh](https://cursor.sh/)
- **Sublime Text**: [sublimetext.com](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

### Optional but Helpful

#### Terminal/Command Line Knowledge
You'll need to run some commands, but don't worry - we provide exact commands to copy and paste.

**Learning Resources:**
- **Windows**: [Command Prompt Basics](https://www.digitalcitizen.life/command-prompt-how-use-basic-commands/)
- **Mac/Linux**: [Terminal Basics](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/command-line-for-beginners/)

#### AI Tool Access
You'll need access to at least one AI assistant. We support many options including free ones!

**Free Options (No Credit Card Required):**
- **Ollama** (Local AI): Completely free, runs on your computer
