# Continuous Deployment Workflow

## Development Phase

### 1. Feature Development
- **Branch Strategy**: Feature branches from main
- **Code Standards**: Automated linting and formatting
- **Testing**: Unit tests with every commit
- **Documentation**: Inline code documentation

### 2. Code Review Process
- **Pull Request**: Required for all changes
- **Reviewers**: At least 2 approvals required
- **Automated Checks**: CI pipeline validation
- **Security Scan**: Vulnerability assessment

## CI/CD Pipeline

### 3. Build Phase
- **Trigger**: Push to main branch
- **Build**: Compile and package application
- **Test**: Run full test suite
- **Quality**: Code coverage and quality gates

### 4. Staging Deployment
- **Environment**: Automated staging deployment
- **Testing**: Integration and E2E tests
- **Performance**: Load and performance testing
- **Security**: Security testing and scanning

### 5. Production Deployment
- **Approval**: Manual approval for production
- **Deployment**: Blue-green or rolling deployment
- **Monitoring**: Real-time deployment monitoring
- **Rollback**: Automated rollback capability
